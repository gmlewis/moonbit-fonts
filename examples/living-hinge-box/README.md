# Living Hinge Parametric Box

This example demonstrates how to design a 3D foldable object where the typography is an integral part of the mechanical structure.

## Features

- **Living Hinges**: Utilizes laser-cut lattice patterns that allow rigid materials like wood to bend.
- **Typographic Hinges**: The lattice pattern is dynamically modified so that the cuts themselves form the shapes of letters. The word is the hinge.
- **Parametric Assembly**: Generates "finger joints" (tabs and slots) automatically based on the thickness of the material.
- **Functional Art**: A beautiful, usable object that showcases the precision of MoonBit's geometry calculations.

## How it Works

1. **Flat Pattern Layout**: Calculates the 2D layout of a box (front, back, sides, top, bottom).
2. **Hinge Calculation**: Determines the placement of the lattice cuts for the rounded corners.
3. **Typographic Integration**: Overlays glyph paths onto the lattice grid, modifying the cut lengths and positions to render the text within the mechanical pattern.
4. **Joint Generation**: Adds tabs and slots to the edges of each panel for easy assembly.

## Usage

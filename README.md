[![check](https://github.com/gmlewis/moonbit-fonts/actions/workflows/check.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/gmlewis/moonbit-fonts/actions/workflows/check.yml)

This is an experimental package to manipulate open source fonts with [MoonBit].

All fonts are open source and their licenses can all be found in their corresponding
repos which are organized by the first letter of the name of the font:

* https://github.com/gmlewis/go-fonts-a/tree/master/fonts/aaarghnormal
* ...
* https://github.com/gmlewis/go-fonts-b/tree/master/fonts/baloo
* ...
* https://github.com/gmlewis/go-fonts-z/tree/master/fonts/znikomitno24

[MoonBit]: https://www.moonbitlang.com/

## Status

The code has been updated to support compiler:

```bash
$ moon version --all
moon 0.1.20240902 (a1bf66a 2024-09-02) ~/.moon/bin/moon
moonc v0.1.20240902+47bcb87c9 ~/.moon/bin/moonc
moonrun 0.1.20240902 (a1bf66a 2024-09-02) ~/.moon/bin/moonrun
```

Use `moonup` to manage `moon` compiler versions:

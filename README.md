[![check](https://github.com/gmlewis/moonbit-fonts/actions/workflows/check.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/gmlewis/moonbit-fonts/actions/workflows/check.yml)

This is an experimental package to manipulate open source fonts with [MoonBit].

All fonts are open source and their licenses can all be found in their corresponding
repos which are organized by the first letter of the name of the font:

* font: https://github.com/gmlewis/mbt-fonts-a/tree/master/aaarghnormal
* license: https://github.com/gmlewis/go-fonts-a/tree/master/fonts/aaarghnormal
* ...
* font: https://github.com/gmlewis/mbt-fonts-b/tree/master/baloo
* license: https://github.com/gmlewis/go-fonts-b/tree/master/fonts/baloo
* ...
* font: https://github.com/gmlewis/mbt-fonts-z/tree/master/znikomitno24
* license: https://github.com/gmlewis/go-fonts-z/tree/master/fonts/znikomitno24

## Examples

### checkerboard

`checkerboard` is a simple example to create a `draw.Graphic` using the `@draw` API.

### canvas-checkerboard

`canvas-checkerboard` renders the `checkerboard` Graphic to an HTML5 canvas.
Type `./run-canvas-checkerboard.sh` in a terminal then open your browser to
http://localhost:8080/examples/canvas-checkerboard to view it.

### svg-checkerboard

`svg-checkerboard` "renders" the `checkerboard` Graphic to an SVG file.
Type `moon run examples/svg-checkerboard > examples/svg-checkerboard/checkerboard.svg`
in a terminal then open this file in your browser to view it.
For example, `google-chrome examples/svg-checkerboard/checkerboard.svg`.

## Status

The code has been updated to support compiler:

```bash
$ moon version --all
moon 0.1.20241202 (28bfce6 2024-12-02) ~/.moon/bin/moon
moonc v0.1.20241202+8756d160d ~/.moon/bin/moonc
moonrun 0.1.20241202 (28bfce6 2024-12-02) ~/.moon/bin/moonrun
```

Use `moonup` to manage `moon` compiler versions:
